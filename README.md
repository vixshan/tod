## Truth or Dare Discord Bot Concept

**Emojis:** üí°üí¨‚ùì

This is a concept for a Discord bot that allows users to play Truth or Dare with their friends. The bot uses a MongoDB database to store questions, which can be added by users with the `dev` slash commands. Users can then play the game by using the `community` slash commands.

**Features:**

* Slash commands for adding and playing the game
* Online MongoDB database to store questions
* Support for Truth, Dare, Paranoia, and Never Have I Ever questions
* Error catching

**Customization:**

* Users can add their own questions to the database
* Server admins can configure the bot's behavior, such as blacklisting certain channels and whitelisting certain users

**How to play:**

1. Invite the bot to your Discord server.
2. Use the `dev` slash commands to add questions to the database.
3. Use the `community` slash commands to play the game with your friends.

**Example:**

```bash
/add-question truth What is your biggest fear?
/dare Sing a karaoke song in front of everyone.
/truth
/dare
```
**Notes:**

* This is a concept bot, so it is not yet fully functional.
* The bot is still under development, so new features and bug fixes will be added over time.
* Feedback is always welcome, so please feel free to leave a comment on this GitHub repository.
